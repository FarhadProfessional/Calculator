<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the Calculator project! As the name suggests, I build a calculator with variety of commonly used functions, interacted by GUI. 
I use the Qt creator IDE to setup the project, due to its excellent internal build tools, especially for GUI. 
The calculator can be used on all platforms.

It supports keyboard presses such as:

* multiplication
* division
* addition
* subtraction
* 0~9 numbers
* delete
* Enter/return


<h2>Requirements</h2>

Qt creator or qmake build system set up in your IDE.
